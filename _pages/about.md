I am a Master's candidate in Computer Engineering at Korea University under the supervision of Prof. Jin Tae Kwak. My research focuses on Medical Image Analysis, specifically utilizing MR and CT images. 

Currently, I am working as a Software Developer and AI Engineer at DeepClue Inc., developing DeepClue-Precise, a software solution for stroke patients.

I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities to further my research.
